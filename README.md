# 📘 42 Piscine — Full Journey Archive

Welcome to my **42 Piscine** repository — a complete archive of everything I worked on during the famous 42 swimming pool (Piscine).
This repo contains **every Shell project, every C module, every Rush, every exam practice**, and additional tools I used along the way.

The goal is simple:
**To keep a clean, organized, and fully documented record of my 42 Piscine experience.**

## 🏁 About the 42 Piscine

The **42 Piscine** is an intense 4-week C programming bootcamp created to push candidates into problem-solving, teamwork, and rapid learning.
Participants work long hours solving exercises that grow increasingly difficult, while following strict coding standards such as the **Norminette**.

This repository contains **all the work I produced during this period**, structured in a clear and accessible way.

## 🧰 What’s Included?

### ✔️ Shell Projects

Foundational projects that teach file manipulation, permissions, simple scripts, and command-line fundamentals.

### ✔️ C Modules (C00–C09)

Each module focuses on a core concept of C programming:

* **C00** — Basics, functions, loops
* **C01** — Pointers & memory
* **C02** — String manipulation
* **C03** — More strings, comparison, concatenation
* **C04** — I/O and basic algorithms
* **C05** — Recursion & math functions
* **C06** — Command-line arguments
* **C07** — Dynamic memory & advanced manipulation
* **C08** — Structs, typedef, header organization
* **C09** — Library creation (libft-style introduction)

### ✔️ Rush Projects

Weekend group projects designed to test collaboration and design skills under time pressure.

### ✔️ Exam Practice

Solutions, attempts, and practice tasks from the piscine exam levels.

### ✔️ Additional Tools

My personal tools for debugging, testing, compiling, and checking code quality.

## 🎯 Objectives of This Repository

* Serve as a **complete historical archive** of my Piscine journey
* Help others who want to understand the structure and type of projects in the 42 curriculum
* Track my **progress and improvements in C programming**
* Provide clean, organized code following **Norminette rules**

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

To compile any C project:

```sh
cc -Wall -Wextra -Werror your_file.c -o program
```

To run:

```sh
./program
```

Tools and scripts inside the repo may simplify this.

---

## 📏 Norminette Compliance

All code is written according to the **42 Norm Version 4.x**, including:

* 25-line function rule
* 5-function file rule
* Forbidden functions handled accordingly
* Header structure & formatting
* Proper memory handling habits

---

## 💬 Final Notes

This repository is **not a guide** but a **personal archive**.
All code reflects what I wrote and learned during the Piscine.
Feel free to explore, learn from it, or compare it with your own journey.

<h1>How to Push a Project ?</h1>

<code> git init </code>
<br> This command is used to create a new Git repository. It turns your current working directory into a Git repository and sets up all the necessary files for Git to track and manage changes.

<code> git add . </code>
<br> This command adds all files and changes in your current working directory to the staging area. It allows Git to track these files and prepare them to be committed.

<code> git commit -m "Message" </code>
<br> This command saves the staged changes as a commit. The <code>-m</code> option is used to include a short message explaining what changes were made and why.

<code> git push repo_link </code>
<br> This command uploads your local commits to the remote Git repository.

<code> git clone repo_link </code>
<br> Note: After pushing your project, you can verify it by cloning your repository using <code>git clone</code>.
